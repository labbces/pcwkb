      "abstract": "Grasses have evolved distinct cell wall composition and patterning relative to dicotyledonous plants. However, despite the importance of this plant family, transcriptional regulation of its cell wall biosynthesis is poorly understood. To identify grass cell wall-associated transcription factors, we constructed the Rice Combined mutual Ranked Network (RCRN). The RCRN covers >90% of annotated rice (Oryza sativa) genes, is high quality, and includes most grass-specific cell wall genes, such as mixed-linkage glucan synthases and hydroxycinnamoyl acyltransferases. Comparing the RCRN and an equivalent Arabidopsis network suggests that grass orthologs of most genetically verified eudicot cell wall regulators also control this process in grasses, but some transcription factors vary significantly in network connectivity between these divergent species. Reverse genetics, yeast-one-hybrid, and protoplast-based assays reveal that OsMYB61a activates a grass-specific acyltransferase promoter, which confirms network predictions and supports grass-specific cell wall synthesis genes being incorporated into conserved regulatory circuits. In addition, 10 of 15 tested transcription factors, including six novel Wall-Associated regulators (WAP1, WACH1, WAHL1, WADH1, OsMYB13a, and OsMYB13b), alter abundance of cell wall-related transcripts when transiently expressed. The results highlight the quality of the RCRN for examining rice biology, provide insight into the evolution of cell wall regulation, and identify network nodes and edges that are possible leads for improving cell wall composition.",

We have refined our identification methods for transposable element-related genes resulting in 13 237 genes that are related to transposable elements. Through incorporation of multiple transcript and proteomic expression data sets, we have been able to annotate 24 799 genes (31 739 gene models), representing ∼50% of the total gene models, as expressed in the rice genome. All structural and functional annotation is viewable through our Rice Genome Browser which currently supports 59 tracks.

        "abstract": "The development of bioenergy crops with reduced recalcitrance to enzymatic degradation represents an important challenge to enable the sustainable production of advanced biofuels and bioproducts. Biomass recalcitrance is partly attributed to the complex structure of plant cell walls inside which cellulose microfibrils are protected by a network of hemicellulosic xylan chains that crosslink with each other or with lignin via ferulate (FA) bridges. Overexpression of the rice acyltransferase OsAT10 is an effective bioengineering strategy to lower the amount of FA involved in the formation of cell wall crosslinks and thereby reduce cell wall recalcitrance. The annual crop sorghum represents an attractive feedstock for bioenergy purposes considering its high biomass yields and low input requirements. Although we previously validated the OsAT10 engineering approach in the perennial bioenergy crop switchgrass, the effect of OsAT10 expression on biomass composition and digestibility in sorghum remains to be explored.",

        "abstract": "The recalcitrance of secondary plant cell walls to digestion constrains biomass use for the production of sustainable bioproducts and for animal feed. We screened a population of Brachypodium recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for cell wall digestibility using commercial cellulases and detected a quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with this trait. Examination of the chromosomal region associated with this QTL revealed a candidate gene that encodes a putative glycosyl transferase family (GT) 43 protein, orthologue of IRX14 in Arabidopsis, and hence predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of xylan. Arabinoxylans form the major matrix polysaccharides in cell walls of grasses, such as Brachypodium. The parental lines of the RIL population carry alternative nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the BdGT43A gene, which were inherited in the RIL progeny in a manner compatible with a causative role in the variation in straw digestibility. In order to validate the implied role of our candidate gene in affecting straw digestibility, we used RNA interference to lower the expression levels of the BdGT43A gene in Brachypodium. The biomass of the silenced lines showed higher digestibility supporting a causative role of the BdGT43A gene, suggesting that it might form a good target for improving straw digestibility in crops.",

        "public_year": "2019-01-01",
        "abstract": "Dedicated lignocellulosic feedstock from grass crops for biofuel production is extensively increasing. However, the access to fermentable cell wall sugars by carbohydrate degrading enzymes is impeded by lignins. These complex polymers are made from reactive oxidized monolignols in the cell wall. Little is known about the laccase-mediated oxidation of monolignols in grasses, and inactivation of the monolignol polymerization mechanism might be a strategy to increase the yield of fermentable sugars. LACCASE5 and LACCASE8 are inactivated in a Brachypodium double mutant. Relative to the wild type, the lignin content of extract-free mature culms is decreased by 20–30% and the saccharification yield is increased by 140%. Release of ferulic acid by mild alkaline hydrolysis is also 2.5-fold higher. Interfascicular fibers are mainly affected while integrity of vascular bundles is not impaired. Interestingly, there is no drastic impact of the double mutation on plant growth. This work shows that two Brachypodium laccases with clearly identified orthologs in crops are involved in lignification of this model plant. Lignification in interfascicular fibers and metaxylem cells is partly uncoupled in Brachypodium. Orthologs of these laccases are promising targets for improving grass feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production.",

Here we report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.",

Understanding how secondary wall biosynthesis is regulated could potentially provide genetic tools for engineering biomass components, especially in maize and Sorghum bicolor. Although many works have focused on secondary wall biosynthesis in dicotyledons, little has been reported for these monocotyledons. In this study, we cloned two NAC transcriptional factor genes, ZmNST3 and ZmNST4, and analyzed their functions in maize secondary wall formation process. ZmNST3 and ZmNST4 were expressed specifically in secondary wall-forming cells, expression of ZmNST3/4 can restore the pendent phenotype of Arabidopsis nst1nst3 double mutant. ZmNST3/4-overexpressing Arabidopsis and maize displayed a thickened secondary wall in the stem, and knockdown maize showed defective secondary wall deposition. ZmNST3/4 could regulate the expression of ZmMYB109/128/149. Our results revealed that ZmNST3/4 are master switches of the maize secondary wall biosynthesis process and provides new evidence that the secondary wall regulatory pathway is conserved in different plant species.",

Definitive evidence on the genes responsible is lacking so we studied a candidate gene that we identified within the BAHD acyl-CoA transferase family. We used RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of orthologs in the model grasses Setaria viridis (SvBAHD01) and Brachypodium distachyon (BdBAHD01) and determined effects on AX feruloylation. Silencing of SvBAHD01 in Setaria resulted in a c. 60% decrease in AX feruloylation in stems consistently across four generations. Silencing of BdBAHD01 in Brachypodium stems decreased feruloylation much less, possibly due to higher expression of functionally redundant genes. Setaria SvBAHD01 RNAi plants showed: no decrease in total lignin, approximately doubled arabinose acylated by p-coumarate, changes in two-dimensional NMR spectra of unfractionated cell walls consistent with biochemical estimates, no effect on total biomass production and an increase in biomass saccharification efficiency of 40–60%. We provide the first strong evidence for a key role of the BAHD01 gene in AX feruloylation and demonstrate that it is a promising target for improvement of grass crops for biofuel, biorefining and animal nutrition applications.",

We produced a platinum-quality genome assembly of S. viridis and de novo assemblies for 598 wild accessions and exploited these assemblies to identify loci underlying three traits: response to climate, a ‘loss of shattering’ trait that permits mechanical harvest and leaf angle, a predictor of yield in many grass crops. With CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing, we validated Less Shattering1 (SvLes1) as a gene whose product controls seed shattering. In S. italica, this gene was rendered nonfunctional by a retrotransposon insertion in the domesticated loss-of-shattering allele SiLes1-TE (transposable element).
